# Ham or Spam Detection using NLP

This project aims to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify messages as either ham or spam using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The model will be trained on a dataset of labeled messages and will be able to predict the class of new, unseen messages.

## NLP

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. It involves the analysis and understanding of human language, enabling computers to process, interpret, and generate natural language.

## Ham

"Ham" refers to legitimate or non-spam messages. These are messages that are not considered unsolicited or unwanted. The goal of the model is to accurately classify messages as ham or spam.

## Spam

"Spam" refers to unsolicited or unwanted messages, typically sent in bulk. These messages are often promotional or contain malicious content. The model aims to identify and classify such messages as spam.

## Installation

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Conclusion

By leveraging NLP techniques, this project aims to develop a robust machine learning model for ham or spam detection. The model will be trained on a labeled dataset and will be able to accurately classify new messages as either ham or spam. This can be useful in various applications, such as email filtering and message prioritization.
